FRME (Facial Recognition and Model Evaluation) is an innovative framework designed to optimize the evaluation of facial recognition models based on the characteristics of specific datasets. By analyzing the dataset's features, such as diversity, size, and quality, FRME intelligently selects the most suitable model for accurate evaluation. This approach not only enhances the reliability of facial recognition outcomes but also streamlines the process of model selection. Through rigorous evaluation metrics, FRME ensures that the chosen models are well-aligned with the dataset requirements, ultimately contributing to improved performance and reduced biases in facial recognition applications.
